# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Time limit: 4 hours

Requirements:
Your job is to write a simple yet performant autocomplete web UI.

The UI should only contain 1 textbox, and when user types something, it should make auto-complete suggestions based on the list of predefined words. For examples of how it should look, refer to Google.com


Notes:
You’re allowed to pick and choose any programming languages (and DB - if any) that you’re comfortable/you think appropriate (please explain why to us afterwards).

The autocomplete mechanism should happen on the server-side instead of client-side.

On the frontend, you are encouraged (but not required) to write your own js code for rendering the list of suggestions.

The list of words for autocomplete can be downloaded here:
